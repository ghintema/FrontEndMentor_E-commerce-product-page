## My process

- Design analysis: extracting font-styles and colors from figma-file.
- defining CSS variables
- defining CSS utility classes
- writing markup, including styles via utility classes
- writing layout for mobile design
- writing layout for tablet and/or desktop
- writing functionality with JavaScript for menu, slider and cart

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript (for menu, slider and cart)


### What I learned

- DOM-Manipulation for for updating the cart
- How to build a fully-functional slider with autoplay-start-stopp, thumbnail-highlightening and swipe-able.
- How to build a modal. I finally decided against the modal in favor for plugin the slider directly in the main page. 
- A lot about stacking, different levels of stacking, different stacking contexts, and z-index in the context of position not(static).


```html

  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
